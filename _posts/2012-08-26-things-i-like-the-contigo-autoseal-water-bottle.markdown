<img src="/images/posts/ContigoAUTOSEAL.jpg" class="right" />I'm a strange person. There are many things that I get really excited about that most people would think are kind of trivial. I don't think I'm alone however when it comes to excitement over water bottles. Nalgenes, camelbaks, they are practically accessories. So like it not, I'm talking about my favorite water bottle.

It's called the [Contiga Autoseal](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003KZKDIG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003KZKDIG&linkCode=as2&tag=matmcm-20). It's has strong, shatter resistant, bpa free plastic like you would expect but the magic is in the lid. Its default "state" is sealed tight, which is really nice. To open it, there is literally a trigger right where you place your hand when you're drinking. So it only is open when you press it and as soon as you remove your had it's closed again.

There isn't too much more to say. If you're looking for a water bottle, [I would definitely recommend this one](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003KZKDIG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003KZKDIG&linkCode=as2&tag=matmcm-20).
