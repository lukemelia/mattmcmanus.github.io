I have a lot of mixed feelings about Ready Player One. All in all, I enjoyed it, but it took work. The biggest challenge for me is that I have no particular affection for the 80s. I found a lot of the book to be, as other reviewers have put it, useless nostalgia porn. It wasn't until the end that Cline had enough depth and tension to tell a compelling story, but he didn't do very much with it. Was he trying to? I doubt it and in the end, that's fine. The book was fun and, for many people, entertaining. But for me, it didn't live up to the hype.
