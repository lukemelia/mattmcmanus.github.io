People often joke that I should be in some sort of sales. I have a tendency to get really excited about some thing I've come across and I have a hard time shutting up about. Every once and while, other people find those things great as well. So while I was thinking about ways I can spice up my site, I realized that this is the perfect venue.

So without further ado, I present to you "Things I Like". A series of posts, hopefully every wednesday, on the things ( Apps, gadgets, trinkets, websites, etc) I like. Enjoy.
