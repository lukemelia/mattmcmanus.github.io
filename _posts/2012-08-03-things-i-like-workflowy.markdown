We all juggle many different lists of things and we all have different systems to attempt to keep it all straight. In the digital realm, it's a serious challenge to find a good tool that works well to simply keep things organized and in-context. Todo apps are nice, but many of the things I'm juggling aren't really to dos. Note taking applications, like [Evernote](http://evernote.com) are also great, but many of my thoughts are complicated/long enough to keep managed in such a large application where it's easy to loose context. 

[Workflowy](http://workflowy.com) to the rescue. It's a web app dedicated to one thing: Making lists. Whats incredible about it though is how fast and easy it easy to make detailed outlines. It's also incredibly easily focus on any particular level of your lists. I use it constantly to keep track of larger tasks I need to follow up on, brainstorming ideas and writing outlines for talks that I'm giving. Watch the video if you're not convinced. I promise you though, it's worth checking out.
