<img src="/images/posts/aero_press_03.jpg" class="right" /> I really like coffee. Sure, the caffeine is great but I genuinely love the flavor. Give me a big cup of a strong dark roast and I'm a happy happy man. Enter the [Aeropress](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047BIWSK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=matmcm-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0047BIWSK). It's a shockingly simple and cheap coffee brewer that makes the best cup of coffee that you can make at home. It works nearly identically to a french press but think of the [Aeropress](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047BIWSK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=matmcm-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0047BIWSK) as the digital to the french press' analog. Not only is the coffee cleaner and smoother, but the cleaning the [Aeropress](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047BIWSK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=matmcm-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0047BIWSK) is trivial. It pushes the grounds out and your rinse it off.

So check it out. It's $30 bucks on amazon and totally worth it.
