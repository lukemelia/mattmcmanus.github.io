Rob Bell is excited. He's excited about a lot of things, but what he is most excited about is the Bible. To those outside of the church the Bible most likely seems rigid and violent. Even those inside of the church have a complicated relationship with it. This book is a of fresh air that tries to cast a vision of the Bible that is bright, hopeful, provocative, and inspiring.

> Why bother with such a strange, old book? Because it’s a book about them, then, that somehow speaks to you and me, here and now, and it can change the way you think and feel about everything.

To those who are unfamiliar with robs work, I think some back story is helpful. Like most interesting people who are doing worthwhile work, you cannot help but react to Rob. He is a personality who at his very core is a pot stirrer. Rob was an evangelical pastor who, through his writings, was labeled dangerous by some and even a heretic by others. That hasn't stopped him from continuing to explore what it means to be a Christian in the 21st century.

His work over the last several years has been focused on speaking to those who are outside of the church, whether they have never been in it or have left it. If you are happily Christian, Rob probably will seem dangerous to you. I do not think I can convince you otherwise. If you look at the state of the Church and are broken hearted or bewildered, if you feel like there is nothing there for you at all or anymore, give this book a read.

In it he gives voice to many thoughts and emotions that have bothered me for years. He does so not just as a critique of the status quo but to provide contrast to the point that he is trying to make. The end result? After you get use to his quirky style of writing and some of his statements that seem a little over-the-top, you're left with hope and excitement to continue onward. Here are a couple samples that I really appreciated:

> Beware of sermons in which the point is to prove something about the Bible. The Bible is not an argument. It is a record of human experience. The point is not to prove that it’s the word of God or it’s inspired or it’s whatever the current word is that people are using. The point is to enter into its stories with such intention and vitality that you find what it is that inspired people to write these books.

> What often happens, then, is people grow up or start reading or travel or go to university or make friends outside of their tribe, and in the process, they discover that things aren’t how they were told things are. They realize that what they were told is simply how it is in an absolute and objective way, is actually a set of interpretations made by actual humans. Humans who have a limited perspective.

> Someone has to decide what the Bible says, what it means, and what that looks like in flesh and blood. This is why so many people are so confused when it comes to the Bible. They were taught by their pastor or parents or authority figures to submit to the authority of the Bible, but that’s impossible to do without submitting first to whoever is deciding what the Bible is even saying. And that requires trust. Because authority is a relational reality.
